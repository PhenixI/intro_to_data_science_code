    In exercise 5, we calculated the R^2 value for you. But why don't you try and
    and calculate the R^2 value yourself.
    
    Given a list of original data points, and also a list of predicted data points,
    write a function that will compute and return the coefficient of determination (R^2)
    for this data.  numpy.mean() and numpy.sum() might both be useful here, but
    not necessary.

    fi_square = np.square(data-predictions).sum()
    mean_y = data.mean()
    y_square = np.square(data-mean_y).sum()

    r_squared = 1- (fi_square/y_square)
    # your code here
    
    return r_squared
